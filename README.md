Start with Docker

Prepare proxy IP (optional)

Save the proxy address to `proxies.txt` a file in the format:

> socks5://username:password@proxyhost:port

Then start the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e APP_USER=user@mail.com \
  -e APP_PASS=password \
  -v ./proxies.txt:/app/proxies.txt \
  overtrue/gradient-bot
```

Noteï¼š`proxies.txt` Please replace the path with the correct path. If there is no proxy, you can leave it blank, or  `cd` go to `proxies.txt` the directory first and then execute the docker run command.

View the operation log

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will list all containers, find the corresponding container ID (the value in the "CONTAINER ID" column), and then execute:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> pm2 logs
```

Deleting a container

```bash
docker rm -f <container_id>
```

Updated version

```bash
# delete old container
docker rm -f <container_id>

# pull new image
docker pull overtrue/gradient-bot

# run new container
docker run -d -e APP_USER=<user@mail.com> -e APP_PASS='<password>' -v ./proxies.txt:/app/proxies.txt overtrue/gradient-bot
```
